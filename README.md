We implemented a three-layered architecture in the project. The display layer, the application layer, and the data layer.

The display layer (UI) design was designed with Figma and coded as widget UI in Flutter.

The application layer was again coded with Dart language and the data was interactively communicated with the data layer. In addition, the application is designed to be published on both Android and IOS markets.

Firebase technology was used in the data layer. Thanks to real-time firebase technology, the posts in the application are stored in Firebase firestore, users are stored in firebase authentication, and their images are stored in firebase storage. In addition, NoSQL was used for the database in this section.


Our application Routely contributes directly to the solution of three sustainable development goals and indirectly to one goal.

Today, as the population of cities increases, it becomes more and more difficult for cities to be sustainable and livable.
Especially in developing countries like our country, which have infrastructure problems and low traffic (driver) culture, the problems in big and mega cities are increasing day by day and cause more and more different problems with the snowball effect.
Therefore, the main target in our focus (11) is SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES. Thanks to Routely, we aim to minimize the problems that the drivers in the cities experience with the infrastructure and with other people. Drivers will be able to warn other drivers by sharing any problem they experience in traffic in the application, drivers who need help will be able to reach other drivers, drivers who do not follow the traffic rules will be punished.

We provide solutions to the objectives of (16) PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS and (17) PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS through partnerships with public institutions related to urbanism, environment and security.In this way, drivers and institutions can easily meet under one roof for the same problem and problems are solved faster. 

Lastly, we indirectly contribute to the (3) GOOD HEALTH & WELL-BEING target, as there will be a better quality of traffic life for drivers when the application achieves its purpose.
